## The Food-Attention Nexus project investigates the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive performance, specifically attention span and cognitive function. This project uses data science and machine learning techniques to analyze how different dietary patterns affect cognitive metrics, identify which populations are most sensitive to these effects, and develop predictive models for personalized nutrition recommendations.

### Using advanced data science and machine learning techniques, we've analyzed how different dietary patterns affect cognitive metrics, identified which populations are most sensitive to these effects, and developed predictive models for personalized nutrition recommendations.

### Our findings provide actionable insights for improving cognitive function through targeted dietary interventions at public health, healthcare provider, and individual levels.
