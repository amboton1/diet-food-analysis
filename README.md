## The Food-Attention Nexus project investigates the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive performance, specifically attention span and cognitive function. This project uses data science and machine learning techniques to analyze how different dietary patterns affect cognitive metrics, identify which populations are most sensitive to these effects, and develop predictive models for personalized nutrition recommendations.
