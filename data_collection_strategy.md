# Data Collection Strategy for Food-Attention Nexus Project

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for collecting and simulating data to investigate the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive performance, specifically attention span. Since we don't have access to real-world data, we will create simulated datasets that realistically represent the variables of interest.

## 1. Wearable & Mobile Data (Cognitive Performance Metrics)

### Variables to Include:
- **Reaction Time (ms)**: Daily average reaction time from cognitive tests
- **Sustained Attention Score (0-100)**: Measure of ability to maintain focus over time
- **Task Switching Cost (ms)**: Time penalty when switching between different tasks
- **Screen Time (minutes)**: Total daily screen time
- **App Usage Patterns**:
  - Social media usage (minutes)
  - Productivity app usage (minutes)
  - Entertainment app usage (minutes)
- **Sleep Quality (0-100)**: Sleep quality score from wearable
- **Sleep Duration (hours)**: Total sleep time
- **Physical Activity (steps)**: Daily step count
- **Heart Rate Variability**: Measure of stress and recovery
- **Time of Day Metrics**: Performance variations throughout the day

### Temporal Aspects:
- Daily measurements over a 90-day period
- Time stamps for each measurement

## 2. Food Purchase & Dietary Data

### Variables to Include:
- **Macronutrient Intake**:
  - Protein (g)
  - Carbohydrates (g)
  - Fats (g)
  - Fiber (g)
- **Micronutrient Intake**:
  - Omega-3 fatty acids (mg)
  - B vitamins (% daily value)
  - Antioxidants (arbitrary units)
  - Vitamin D (IU)
- **Food Categories**:
  - Processed food consumption (servings)
  - Vegetable and fruit consumption (servings)
  - Whole grain consumption (servings)
  - Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (servings)
- **Meal Timing**:
  - Breakfast time
  - Lunch time
  - Dinner time
  - Snacking frequency
- **Dietary Patterns**:
  - Mediterranean diet adherence score (0-100)
  - High-protein diet adherence score (0-100)
  - High-fiber diet adherence score (0-100)
  - Western diet adherence score (0-100)
- **Grocery Purchase Data**:
  - Weekly grocery categories (% of total)
  - Food brand preferences

### Temporal Aspects:
- Daily food intake records
- Weekly grocery purchase records

## 3. Health Records & Demographics

### Variables to Include:
- **Demographics**:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Education level
  - Occupation
  - Socioeconomic status
  - Geographic location
- **Health Metrics**:
  - BMI
  - Blood pressure
  - Cholesterol levels
  - Blood glucose levels
  - Existing health conditions
  - Medication use
- **Lifestyle Factors**:
  - Smoking status
  - Alcohol consumption
  - Exercise habits
  - Stress levels (self-reported)
  - Work schedule (regular/shift work)

### Temporal Aspects:
- Static demographic data
- Monthly health metrics

## 4. Data Integration Strategy

### Participant IDs
- Create unique participant IDs to link data across all three datasets
- Ensure consistent time periods across datasets

### Temporal Alignment
- Align daily cognitive performance with daily dietary intake
- Account for potential lag effects (dietary impacts may not be immediate)

### Data Quantity
- Simulate data for 500 participants
- 90 days of continuous data collection
- Approximately 45,000 daily records total

## 5. Simulated Data Characteristics

### Realistic Patterns
- Incorporate day-of-week effects (weekday vs. weekend differences)
- Include seasonal variations if applicable
- Model realistic correlation structures between variables

### Noise and Missing Data
- Add realistic measurement noise to variables
- Simulate missing data patterns (e.g., participants occasionally forgetting to log meals)
- Include outliers at realistic frequencies

### Known Relationships
- Embed known nutritional effects on cognition based on literature
- Include confounding factors that might influence both diet and cognition

## 6. Data Format and Storage

### File Formats
- CSV files for each data category
- JSON for nested data structures if needed

### Data Dictionary
- Create comprehensive data dictionary documenting all variables
- Include units, valid ranges, and descriptions

## 7. Ethical Considerations

Although using simulated data, we will:
- Design the simulation to reflect realistic privacy concerns
- Avoid creating unrealistic or misleading relationships
- Document all assumptions made in the simulation process

This data collection strategy provides a comprehensive framework for creating realistic simulated datasets that will allow us to explore the relationship between dietary patterns and cognitive performance using machine learning techniques.
